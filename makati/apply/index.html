		        <p>The                             new application system of <b>#Makati</b> is   established in                             order to instill discipline to our aspirants.   All who                             desires to be a part of our team must pass our   standards                             and should show proper behavior and attitude.   It is                             expected of you to always read the topic set   so that                             you will be updated on current issues and   announcements.                             You say that you have not   been informed.                             It is your duty to keep yourself abreast with   our status.                             Here are the rules regarding our Channel 
                Operator's   application                             process:</p>
                <p align="left">1.                             You can send your 
                <i>Application Email</i> anytime.   See template                             below. <br />
                  2. You will be notified through email and/or   MemoServ                             if your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application has been                             approved or rejected.<br />
                  3. Once you are an approved applicant, all you   need                             to do is wait.<br />
                  4. Wait for what? Wait for an SOP to finally   recommend                             you.<br />
                  5. While you wait, you have to show us that   you are                             worthy to be<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an operator. That's the only                             way you can convince an SOP to <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally recommend you. <br />
                  6. Once you are recommended by an SOP, you   will be informed                             and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we will schedule you for an interview with our team.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the SOP who recommended                             you will be accountable<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your actions once you are                             given an access.<br />
                  7. You must be present on the interview date.   You are                             only allowed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to ask for a reschedule once. Otherwise,                             you will have to wait for <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another month before we can interview                             you again.<br />
                  8. After the interview, a vote will be made by SOPs and 
                  Founder<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within 10-days. Whether you                             will be accepted or not, it solely<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depends on the decision of the                             majority 
  SOP/Founder.<br />
                  9. You will then be notified about the result   when the                             10-day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duration is over. We wish you the                             best. :)<br />
                  10. Rejected applicants and those who failed   the recommendation <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process can re-apply only after three (3)                             months from the date of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notification.<br />
                  11. We reserve the right to reject any   application which                             is suspicious <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in form or from a user with untoward                             behavior/attitude. We're <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expecting sincere channel helpers,                             not mere access collectors.&nbsp; <br />
                  12. We also reserve the right to bypass an   applicant's                             application &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure if we                             think they deserve it. 
                  Founder has the last say.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size: 16pt">important Guidelines</span></h1></div>
			  <div class="postcontent">
			    <p>Here are   some tips to increase your chances                             in getting<br />
a recommendation from our SOP's:<br />
<br />
1. Your Nick must be presentable (Not Offensive; Not too   long; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;does not contain too much non-alphanumeric                             characters)<br />
2. Must know how to respect. That's the only   way you                             can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gain respect from us.<br />
3. Must be willing to help the operators   without expecting <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; anything&nbsp;in return.<br />
4. Entertain chatters and help those who are   in need. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (ex. helping&nbsp;newbies with basic commands)<br />
5. Most important is you should know how to   <b>FOLLOW</b> simple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions. If you fail this, your application will automatically <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; be ignored                             or rejected with no prior notice.</p>
